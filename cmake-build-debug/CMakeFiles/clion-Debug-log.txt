CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:39 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable AUTOTESTER_ROOT is set to:

    /Users/weipinglim/Desktop/MAC_M1_StartupSPASolution/A0227157A_A0227000A/Code-A0227157A_A0227000A/lib/autotester/apple

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at /Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/mac/aarch64/share/cmake-3.27/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (AUTOTESTER)
  does not match the name of the calling package (Autotester).  This can lead
  to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake/FindAutotester.cmake:33 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:39 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
